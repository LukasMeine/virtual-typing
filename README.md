# Virtual Typing

Dead simple Python utility to simulate a real person typing, bypassing copy/paste protected fields. 
Particularly useful in scenarios where there is some sort of intelligence/service monitoring the data fields in real-time
and reporting copying/pasting as unwanted behavior.

 ## Features

 - Occasional typos and autocorrection
 - A quick pause when finishing sentences ( after periods, colons, and semicolons )
 - Respects spacing and line breaking
 - A simple timer before the virtual typing starts typing so you have time to switch the focus between virtual typing and your destination
